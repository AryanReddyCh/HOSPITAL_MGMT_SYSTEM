Project Name: HOSPITAL_MGMT_SYSTEM 🏥💻
Project Description:
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive data platform designed to manage the core functions of a hospital. This system efficiently integrates patient data, appointments, billing, hospital information, insurance, and physician details to provide seamless, real-time insights for better decision-making and operational efficiency. The project leverages the power of dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform, stage, and analyze hospital-related data across multiple environments (staging, integration, mart, and lists).

With a focus on healthcare, the project offers data insights into patient care, treatment schedules, financials, insurance claims, and more, all in an organized, structured manner. The HMS uses a cloud-based data warehouse to store and process these datasets, enabling hospital administrators to quickly access key performance metrics, monitor operations, and ensure quality healthcare delivery.

Key Features:
Data Transformation: Automates data transformations for hospital data (patients, billing, appointments) through dbt models.
Multi-Schema Architecture: Organizes data in multiple layers such as staging, integration, and mart for streamlined processing and reporting.
Customizable Seed Files: Configures different delimiters for varied raw input files, ensuring smooth import of data from multiple sources.
Snapshots: Captures historical data at different time intervals to track changes in patient data and hospital metrics over time.

Architecture Components:
Data Sources 📊: Raw data comes from various hospital systems such as patient records, appointment logs, billing details, physician information, and insurance claims.
Raw Data (Seeds) 🌱: Data is loaded into raw staging tables with specific delimiters.
Staging Models (stg) 📥: This layer captures the unprocessed data and prepares it for integration.
Integration Models (int) 🔄: The integration layer focuses on cleaning, transforming, and consolidating data from multiple sources to create a unified data set.
Data Mart (mart) 📈: A presentation layer where structured data is made available for BI tools to generate reports and dashboards.
Snapshots 📸: Captures snapshots of historical data, such as changes in patient records, to analyze trends and generate historical insights.
Data Warehouse (Snowflake) 🌐: The data warehouse is the centralized cloud storage, which powers all downstream processes and provides scalability for big data storage and processing.
Reports/BI & Dashboards 📅: Business Intelligence tools like Tableau or Power BI are used to generate dashboards for real-time insights into hospital performance.
